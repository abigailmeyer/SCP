            <h1><strong>Hello! I'm Abigail and this is my Senior Capstone Project, "Where are you from?".</strong><br></h1>
            <p>This is a multimedia interview based project that discusses the challanges and experiences that third culture kids face throughout their lifetime.</p>

                <h2>Where are you from?</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Throughout my time at Fordham as a New Media and Information student I have gained a lot of different skills that will benefit me for the rest of my professional career. My major has allowed me to take a variety of classes including basic
                coding courses, visual arts courses, and much more. <br><br>Developing an idea for this project was really challenging because I hit a bit of a creative block at the beginning of the semester, but eventually came up with something.
                <br><br>I grew up with two parents who worked for the government and I have moved 12 times so I’ve never really had a sense of “home”. My parents always called my siblings and I “Third Culture Kids” but I never really understood the termination
                until I recently read a book titled ‘I’m From...Earth?’.
                <br><br>Third culture kids or third culture individuals are people who were raised in a culture other than their parents' or the culture of their country of nationality, and also live in a different environment during a significant part
                of their child development years. <br><br>I decided to develop an interview based, multimedia project that would consist of interviews with other Third Culture Kids, to create a space where third culture kids can talk about their experiences
                and more. The website is coded by me and there is no use of a third party platform. </p>

                    <h3>Myself</h3>
                    <p>Hi, I'm Abigail and I'm from nowhere! I thought since I am interviewing TCKs I should probably take time to interview myself since my personal experiences as a TCK inspired this project. During this audio clip, I talk about my inspiration
                        behind the project and what I learned, enjoy!

                    <h3>Jasmine Petrov</h3>
                    <p>Jasmine grew up in Jakcson Heights, Queens, the most culturally diverse neighborhood in all of the United States. With a mom from Russia and a dad from Trinidad, Jasmine has always felt a bit of confusion when it comes to telling people
                        where she is from. </p><br>

                    <p>Montarius, who also goes by Montee, grew up in Stuttgart, Germany. Throughout our interview we talked about the struggles he faced moving to a different country for the first time and how hard it was to familiarize himself with cultural
                        norms that he wasn’t used to. </p><br>

                    <p>Lara, who calls home Switzerland, grew up moving all around the world due to her fathers job. Throughout our interview we talked about the positives and negatives of being a TCK and how it has affected her throughout her whole life
                        and how it continues to affect her to this day. </p><br>

                    <p>Sam, a military brat, moved all over the US and spent time living in other countries. Sam was from the south, but changed his mind towards the end of our interview, it's interesting how a couple of questions changed Sams answer.</p><br>

                    <p>Sophia, from Austin, Texas, grew up in Austin but spent a majority of her summers in Greece, as that is where her dad is from. She currently attends university in Spain and struggles with her identity when it comes to telling people
                        where she's from due to the fact that she does not associate herself with “the Greeks” or “the Americans”. </p><br>
